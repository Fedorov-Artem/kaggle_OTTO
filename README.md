# kaggle_OTTO
## Task and solution overview.
This is the code for kaggle competition called "OTTO â€“ Multi-Objective Recommender System". OTTO is Germany's largest online retailer. The task is to predict, which exact
next item user is going to click next and which items user is going to add to cart or order before the end of the test period. The competition data is real life new users'
sessions on OTTO web site. Test dataset includes one week of users' sessions, truncked at a random point. Oragnizers also provide participants with history of full 
user's sessions for four weeks, preceeding the test period. But no metainformation is avalable for all the items, that show up in both datasets. Participants only
have item id's, that are called AIDs, and there are about 1.8 mln AIDst showing up in the competition data, including both full and truncked user sessions.
